# Regression_fromScratch
A group project to implement Regression analysis course concept 
## Dataset discrbtion 
The data set contains customer behavior data and the amount of money they spent for the business by year.

## 1. Simple linear regression
To detect the relation between "length of the customer membership" as the independent variable to predict the "amount they may spend" as the dependent variable.<br>
> * Estimating the regression line parameters
> * Creating Anova table and test the hypothesis that the feature is related to the target
> * calculate the confidence interval at specific significant level
> * plotting regression line and the prediction interval


## 2. Multiple linear regression
To detect the relation between multiple feature and the amount the customer may spend. <br>
> * A function to customize the which features are the independent variables and the target
> * Update calculations to be applicable with matrices
> * Creating Anova table and test the hypothesis that *at least* one of the features is related to the target
> * Create Variance covariance matrix *"The covariance between the coefficients was small which indicated that there’s no 2 feature have the same impact on the traget."*
> * Calculate and plot studentized residuals to evalute the performance and detect if their is any collinearity.

## 3. final insights
As shown the coefficient of “Length of Membership” is the highest , which indicates that this feature has the most positive impact on the amout that the customer spent on this business. <br>
And the “Time on Website” is the least.
